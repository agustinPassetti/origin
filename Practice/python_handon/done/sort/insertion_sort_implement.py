# Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the insertion sort algorithm.
# Note: According to Wikipedia "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds 
# the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large
# lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort."

# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort 

# Function to do insertion sort 
def insertionSort(arr): 

	# Traverse through 1 to len(arr) 
	for i in range(1, len(arr)): 

		key = arr[i] 

		# Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are 
		# greater than key, to one position ahead 
		# of their current position 
		j = i-1
		while j >=0 and key < arr[j] : 
				arr[j+1] = arr[j] 
				j -= 1
		arr[j+1] = key 


# Driver code to test above 
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6] 
insertionSort(arr) 
print ("Sorted array is:") 
for i in range(len(arr)): 
	print ("%d" %arr[i])
